          1. Measurements of residual thickness of ship structures.</div>
        <br>
        Our company carries out work on flaw detection of ship hulls with measurements of residual thickness. <br>
        The company's employees performing flaw detection are certified to work on ships of various types, both at shipyards and
        during voyages, performing pre-repair flaw detection and preparing the vessel for repair at the shipyard. <br>
        The company is certified by classification societies for the right to perform residual thickness measurements. <br>
        Thickness measurements are carried out using ultrasonic devices, which allow you to preserve the paintwork of
        structures. Based on the results of defect detection, technological instructions for repair are drawn up, with a
        description of the parameters of the areas being repaired, including weight characteristics. At the same time,
        economical and technological repair methods are used, both the requirements of the Register Class and the wishes of the
        shipowner are taken into account. <br>
        Based on the results of measurements of residual thicknesses, a "Report on measurements of residual thicknesses" is
        drawn up in the scope of the class requirements. The "report" is sent to the shipowner for review and agreed with the
        class inspector.. <br>
        In the process of ship repair, our employees carry out technological support and control over the implementation of
        repair work, promptly resolve issues that arise with representatives of the shipyard and the Register Class. <br>
        The company performs work related to the determination of the technical condition of the vessel: <br>
        - expert assessment of the technical condition of the ship's hull at the request of the shipowner, including a photo
        report; <br>
        - inspection of the vessel as a result of accidental damage and the development of recommendations for repair; <br>
        - pre-sale inspection of the vessel at the request of the buying company.
